While building an Expo managed workflow app, I encountered an unexpected error during the `expo prebuild` step. The error message was vague, mentioning issues with the project structure or dependencies, but didn't pinpoint the exact cause.  The build process would halt without generating any useful log details for debugging.  Cleaning the cache and reinstalling node modules didn't resolve the issue.
